## B-bopbot

### Purpose
This is a discord bot designed to mimic and satirize jokes that happen in our discord server.  Everything said is mostly jokes and not meant to be taken seriously.  
This is mostly what I wanted to do and learn about the Discord Python documentation

### Usage
Create an ENV file with your discord access token and change Admin Var to your discord username  
Change @roles and @usernames with desired ones  
Change switch statements for desired images (or don't)  

### Credits
SonuTheNecro - Mostly had to read a bunch of Documentation for discord.py and create the bot  JigglyJello - Wrote Argument Winner and provided a lot of ideas
