Hatterene goon fest time. Who's down to pull up?
Why did Brian decide to become a surf enthusiast? Because he's already used to riding the waves of financial ruin after spending all his money on "Wuthering Waves"! Who needs a savings account when you can catch the perfect virtual wave, right? üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí∏
Why did Brian get promoted to "Manager of Every Department" at Jewel Osco? Because he's mastered the ultimate multitasking skill: playing Clash Royale in the back while on the clock! Now, if only he could figure out how to use those elixirs to speed up the checkout lines...
Why did Brian swear off McDonald's? Because after one too many trips to the drive-thru, he realized he was lovin' the food but hatin' the waistline! Now, instead of Big Macs, he's all about counting his macros.
Why did Brian struggle with the Lethal Company quota math? Because every time he tried to calculate his targets, he ended up with a "lethal dose" of confusion! Looks like his calculations were more hazardous than helpful.
Why did Brian spend $3,000 on a $2,000 computer?Because he wanted to upgrade his tech game, but he accidentally added a "premium procrastination" fee to his checkout cart! Now his computer is so advanced, it's probably already playing games from the future.
I hope to get a god pack in Pok√©mon Pocket or I am going to have to spend $100 to get the cards I want soon...
I have been on that bulk maxx recently!  I even quit pop (soda)!
I invested all of my work money into Hawk Tuah Coin!  Hopefully, I make my money back.

Alright I /buy all the bowblax mustard ghost plushies!  Hopefully i make my money back.
